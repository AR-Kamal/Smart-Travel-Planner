## Overview

This repository contains a **prototype implementation of MaiKedah**, a smart tourism planning platform developed for **academic, learning, and portfolio purposes**. The prototype demonstrates the **core idea, system architecture, and technical approach** behind the project, and serves as a proof-of-concept rather than a full production system.

👉 **Live / Actual Application:**  
🔗 https://maikedah.vercel.app/

The live application represents the **actively developed and more complete version** of MaiKedah, with improved features, UI, and overall stability beyond what is shown in this prototype.

## Project Motivation

Tourists often face difficulties planning trips in unfamiliar destinations due to scattered information, inefficient routes, and lack of personalization. MaiKedah addresses this by proposing a **smart, data-driven tourism planning system** that generates optimized itineraries based on user preferences, budget, and time constraints, while also laying the foundation for tourism analytics.

This prototype focuses on validating:
- The feasibility of personalized itinerary generation
- The overall system design and architecture
- Frontend–backend integration using modern web technologies

---

## What This Prototype Demonstrates

- Core concept of AI-assisted tourism planning  
- Destination and place discovery workflow  
- Basic itinerary generation logic  
- Clean and scalable project structure  
- Practical use of modern full-stack technologies  

⚠️ Some advanced features (e.g. full analytics, large-scale optimization) are **out of scope or partially implemented** in this repository and are explored further in the live version.

## Tech Stack (Prototype)

- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication), Node.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **APIs:** Google Maps APIs (conceptual / partial)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Deployment (Live App):** Vercel
